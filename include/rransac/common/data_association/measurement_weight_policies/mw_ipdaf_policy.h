/** \class MW_IPDAFPolicy 
 * This policy class is inherited by DataAssociationHost when selected. It is responsible to calculate the weights for each track associated measurement. 
 * This class assumes that the track likelihood info policy used is TLI_IPDAFPolicy; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. The weights are calculated according 
 * to the integrated probabilistic data association filter in 
 * Musicki, D., Evans, R., & Stankovic, S. (1994). Integrated probabilistic data association. IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 39(6), 1237â€“1241.
 * The value of delta in equation 2.14 and the measurement probabilities are calculated by the policy TLI_IPDAFPolicy and stored in ModelBase::model_likelihood_update_info_. 
 * This value of delta and the measurement probabilities are used to calculate the weights according to equation 2.18 in the referenced paper. 
 * 
 * The Measurement Weight Policies must implement two member functions PolicyCalculateMeasurementWeight and PolicyCalculateMeasurementWeightSingle. The former is responsible 
 * for calculating the measurement weights for all of the track associated measurements and is used by the DataAssociationHost. The latter is responsible for calculating
 * the measurement weights for all of the measurements associated to a single track. 
 * 
 * Lastly, this policy must have a struct titled CompatiblityCheck. It is given the validation region policy and the update track likelihood policy as template parameters. This struct 
 * calculates if these other policies are compatible with this policy.
